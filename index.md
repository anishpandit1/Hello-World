Okay Okay...
I am a nerd, a tech ethusiast, sort of live in the moment kinda person. I am also a huge fan of Marvel Comics. Star-Lord and Deadpool are my favourites. Not just technology, I like science and the scientific inventions that makes our life easier. As Norman Osborn, I'm also something of a scientist myself. I read and watch alot of science stuffs. I read a lot of Richard Dawkins and The Selfish Gene is the best one for me. I follow my boy NDT as he is the best science educator and is breaking the myths and norms that aren't scientific and just bear religious significance. I am mentioning all these about my because I know my biographers gonna wanna mention these in thier books.

I did my internship as well as worked at ClassicTech Pvt Ltd. It is an internet service provider. And during that period I developed my fondness for Cybersecurity and I am focusing lot more on how to become a Cybersecurity engineer.
